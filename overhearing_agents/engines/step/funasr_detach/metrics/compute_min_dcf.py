# This script computes the minimum detection cost function, which is a common
# error metric used in speaker recognition.  Compared to equal error-rate,
# which assigns equal weight to false negatives and false positives, this
# error-rate is usually used to assess performance in settings where achieving
# a low false positive rate is more important than achieving a low false
# negative rate.  See the NIST 2016 Speaker Recognition Evaluation Plan at
# https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2016/10/07/sre16_eval_plan_v1.3.pdf
# for more details about the metric.
